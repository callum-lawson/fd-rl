Experiments with frequency-dependent selection in reinforcement learning

## Key questions

- What sorts of problems are better solved by:
    - Coalition of specialist strategies
    - Stochastic (mixed) strategies
    - Conservative (generalist) strategies

- Which methods are best at finding these solutions?:
    - RL
    - Evolutionary algorithms (turn off enviornmental feedback)
    - Frequency-dependent selection
